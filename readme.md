# Conditional Diffusion in PyTorch Lightning

This repo includes several implmentations of conditional diffusion models in PyTorch Lightning. There are three main implementations:
- `conditional_ddpm_lightning`: A diffusion model trained on the MNIST dataset to generate images of a specific digit.
- `language-conditional-ddpm-lightning`: A diffusion model trained on the MNIST dataset to generate images of a specific digit conditioned on a text description of the digit.
- `push_t_lightning`: A diffusion model trained to predict actions over a horizon on the push-T dataset.
